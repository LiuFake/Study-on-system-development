# LiuCanMin's weekly reports
## Week 1
### (1) Learning hours:

about 18 hours in this week,about 2 hours per day and one day spent half a day.

### (2) Learning progress:

I have learned the use of pointers, arrays, structures, file operations, input and output in C.  

I also learned some knowledge about Linux this week.  

And I have some simple cognition and learning about git.

### (3) Implementation of the tasks I have done this week:

About Linux : This week, I first installed WSL to create a Linux environment, but there were problems during the configuration process. I first STFW to solve some problems, but still some problems were not solved. After asking others, I also failed to solve them. Finally, I followed others' suggestions to install VMware to create a Linux environment. In creating a good Linux environment, I learned some simple command line instructions and wrote C language programs in Linux.  

About C : For pointer, array, structure and other related knowledge, the program has been written and can be used skillfully in the process of programming . I know the basic operation of debug, and I have debugged myself: single step debugging, monitoring variables, etc. However, when compiling C language programs at the command line terminal, I am not very skilled, and I need to compare the data step by step.  

About Git : I have read some materials and made some understanding, but I have not actually operated.  

### (4) Unsolved problems：

I am not particularly proficient in all the contents. I only operate according to the command, and I haven't memorized them all. 

### (5) Plan for the next week:

Review the content I have learned this week, and study "常用工具" to learn about the server. If the learning progress is OK, I will start learning computer network as planned.And I want to learn some knowledge about c++.
