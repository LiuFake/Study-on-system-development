About Linux:This week, I first installed WSL to create a Linux environment, but there were problems during the configuration process. I first STFW to solve some problems, but still some problems were not solved. After asking others, I also failed to solve them. Finally, I followed others' suggestions to install VMware to create a Linux environment. In creating a good Linux environment, I learned some simple command line instructions and wrote C language programs in Linux.
