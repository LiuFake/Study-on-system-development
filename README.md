# LiuCanMin's weekly reports
## Week 1
### (1) Learning hours:

about 18 hours in this week,about 2 hours per day and one day spent half a day.

### (2) Learning progress  
I have learned the use of pointers, arrays, structures, file operations, input and output in C.

I also learned some knowledge about Linux this week.  

And I have some simple cognition and learning about git.

### (3) Implementation of the tasks I have done this week:

**About Linux :** This week, I first installed WSL to create a Linux environment, but there were problems during the configuration process. I first STFW to solve some problems, but still some problems were not solved. After asking others, I also failed to solve them. Finally, I followed others' suggestions to install VMware to create a Linux environment. In creating a good Linux environment, I learned some simple command line instructions and wrote C language programs in Linux.  

**About C :** For pointer, array, structure and other related knowledge, the program has been written and can be used skillfully in the process of programming . I know the basic operation of debug, and I have debugged myself: single step debugging, monitoring variables, etc. However, when compiling C language programs at the command line terminal, I am not very skilled, and I need to compare the data step by step.  

**About Git :** I have read some materials and made some understanding, but I have not actually operated.  

### (4) Unsolved problems：

I am not particularly proficient in all the contents. I only operate according to the command, and I haven't memorized them all. 

### (5) Plan for the next week:

Review the content I have learned this week, and study some tools in  `常用工具` to learn about the server. If the learning progress is OK, I will start learning computer network as planned.And I want to learn some knowledge about c++.

## Week 2

### (1) Learning hours:  

about 10 hours . *Because I have some other things to deal with this week, so I have less time to study than last week.*

### (2) Learning progress:

I have implemented a series of git operations in the configured Linux virtual machine, and have a certain understanding of git .  

I successfully connected to my virtual machine using MobaXterm .  

And I also learned some about `计算机网络:自顶而下方法` .  

I also learned some simple knowledge about Markdown when I wrote this weekly report.

### (3) Implementation of the tasks I have done this week:  

**About "常用工具" :**  I downloaded the Mobaxterm and learned about SSH . I'm also debugging the VScode environment . I also used functions such as single step debugging and variable monitoring in the process of writing code .

**About git :** I tried using some git instructions . But something wrong happened when I used the `git remove` . I have used `git clone` to copy my repository from my github to my compter before, but there is no remote host, even if  I used the `git remove add` remote host is useless .   I successfully connected my virtual machine . 

**About computer network :** I read some information about computer network, and I feel that it contains a lot of content , and it is unrealistic to read all of it in a week . So I tried to read some code about the establishment of echo server, and then slowly learn and understand it

### (4) Unsolved problems：

I have no idea when I see the such thick ref  `计算机网络：自顶而下方法`, ~~I do not know how to start it and finish the final task~~ , but I'm try to do it. I'm going to do the program first , and then learn the knowledge in the process of doing the program .

### (5) Plan for the next week:  

I plan to continue to learn the relevant knowledge of computer network, and then get familiar with Linux system . 

## Week 3

### (1) Learning hours:   

about 10 hours .

### (2) Learning progress:

I learned some knowledge about computer network . I also read the popular science knowledge of 5g communication . I also reviewed the previous learning contents .

### (3) Implementation of the tasks I have done this week:  

About review : I went through the whole process from editing C language source files to running executable programs again on the Linux virtual machine . I reviewed the content of last week again, compiled and debugged the C language program using gdb in the Linux environment, and completed the single step debugging, monitoring variables and other operations . 

### (4) Unsolved problems：

### (5) Plan for the next week:
